"""
Background Refresh Scheduler
Uses APScheduler to periodically recalculate S/R zones.
- Full 4h refresh: every 4h candle close (00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC)
- Full 1D refresh: daily at 00:02 UTC (only once per day)
- Minor update: every 1h candle close

All jobs filter to active sessions only (FIX-SCH-1), use staggered minute
offsets to avoid concurrent DB commits (FIX-SCH-5), and include
coalesce + max_instances guards (FIX-SCH-10).
